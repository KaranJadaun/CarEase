# CarEase App

A car-shopping android application, with a catalog of 15+ cars. Comes with secure login authentication system using firebase, cart management system and beautiful UI animations using lottie animations. I have followed the object oriented programming principles to make concepts easier to understand. Made UML and class diagrams before writing any code.
